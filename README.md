# SV detection with pangenome graphs

Scripts for my master thesis. 
Testing:

* [pggb](https://github.com/pangenome/pggb) _- the pangenome graph builder_
* [vg](https://github.com/vgteam/vg) - _giraffe for SR mapping to graph, call for genotype calling_
* [pangenie](https://github.com/eblerjana/pangenie) _- k-mer based genotyping, no mapping step_
